		<h2>So many shapes, colors and sizes</h2>

		<p>Cats have flexible bodies and teeth adapted for hunting 
		small animals such as mice and rats. A group of cats is called a clowder, 
		a male cat is called a tom, a female cat is called a molly or queen while 
		young cats are called kittens.</p>
		
		<p>There are many breeds of domestic cats, from long-haired Persians to 
		hairless Sphynx. Why so many? Cats were domesticated, or tamed to be 
		friendly with humans, in Egypt more than 5,000 years ago.</p> 

		<p>Tamed cats were later brought to Europe, Asia and then North America, 
		where new breeds developed because of the different climate, environment 
		and breeding with different local cats. We now see all sorts of cats like 
		grey tabbies, black cats with white socks, tortoiseshell, orange striped 
		and a lot of different combinations.</p>

		Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. 
		I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.
